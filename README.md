# kleinanzeigen-bot-ui

> This fork has an experimental first-contact endpoint at `POST /api/messages/start`.
> It uses the signed-in user's messaging cookies and the contact form on the
> target ad page. It requires `adId`, `message`, and `confirmation: "SENDEN"`;
> `contactName` is optional when the user's profile has a contact name.
> The ad ID and CSRF token are checked before submission. Unit tests and a
> production build pass, but no real first message has been sent or verified.
> An HTTP-accepted response is not treated as proof of message delivery; check
> the inbox before considering the operation complete or retrying it.
> Do not deploy this feature for routine use until an authorized end-to-end
> test confirms the website's response and conversation creation.

**A self-hosted web interface for [kleinanzeigen-bot](https://github.com/Second-Hand-Friends/kleinanzeigen-bot)**

## Features

### Ad Management

- **Full CRUD** — Create, edit, duplicate, and delete ad listings via YAML
- **Grid & Table views** — Toggle between card layout and sortable table; table has sticky title/action columns, scroll shadows, and columns for APR status, visitors, watchlist, and expiry date
- **Bulk actions** — Select multiple ads for publish, delete, update, activate, or deactivate in one operation
- **Image management** — Drag-drop upload, reorder, preview thumbnails, automatic Sharp compression
- **Search & filter** — Full-text search across titles and categories, filter by status or category
- **Category picker** — Hierarchical browser with 582 categories, search, and breadcrumb navigation
- **Live stats** — Visitor count, watchlist count, and expiry date fetched live from the KA management API after each bot run
- **Reserved detection** — Ads paused on kleinanzeigen.de (`state: paused`) are automatically marked as `active: false` locally and shown as "Reserviert"; reverting the pause on KA restores them to active

#### Ad Status System

Each ad has exactly one status, determined by priority:

| Priority | Status | Badge | Condition |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Entwurf** | `muted` (gray) | No kleinanzeigen.de ID and not archived (never published) |
| 2 | **Reserviert** | `reserved` (violet) | KA state is `paused`, or title contains "reserviert" |
| 3 | **Inaktiv** | `danger` (red) | Manually deactivated, automatically deactivated, or archived |
| 4 | **Abgelaufen** | `danger` (red) | Published > 60 days ago |
| 5 | **Läuft bald ab** | `warning` (orange) | Expires within 7 days |
| 6 | **Verwaist** | `warning` (orange) | Has ID but no longer found online (grayscale image) |
| 7 | **Geändert** | `info` (blue) | Content hash differs from stored hash |
| 8 | **Aktiv** | `success` (green) | Published and active |

#### Ad Sync & Orphan Detection

After every bot run that uses Chrome (login required), the system automatically:

1. **Fetches online state** — Queries the KA management API (`m-meine-anzeigen-verwalten.json`) for all pages in parallel
2. **Syncs online IDs** — Writes the current set of online IDs to `.last_download_all.json`
3. **Syncs reserved state** — Ads with `state: paused` on KA get `active: false` in the local YAML; un-paused ads get `active: true` restored
4. **Detects orphans** — Any local ad with an ID not in the online set is shown as "Verwaist"

After a successful `download --ads=all`, the system additionally:

5. **Migrates settings** — If an orphaned ad has a title+category match in the new downloads (re-published with new ID), user settings are transferred:
   - `auto_price_reduction`, `republication_interval`, `description_prefix/suffix`, `shipping_options`, `sell_directly`
   - Bot-managed fields (`repost_count`, `content_hash`, timestamps) are NOT migrated
6. **Removes duplicates** — The old orphaned file is deleted after successful migration
7. **Deactivates remaining orphans** — Ads without a match are set to `active: false`

This ensures local state always matches what's online — no manual cleanup needed.

#### AI-Powered Ad Generation

- **Vision analysis** — Upload product photos, AI extracts details and generates a complete listing
- **Text generation** — Title (max 65 chars), structured description with bullet points, price estimation
- **Category auto-selection** — AI picks the best matching category from 582 categories
- **Attribute suggestions** — AI fills special attributes (color, size, condition) based on category and description
- **Shipping suggestions** — Carrier and cost recommendations based on item size
- **Price estimation** — Condition-based pricing derived from image analysis
- **Provider** — OpenRouter API (GPT-4.1-nano for text, GPT-4.1-mini for vision)

### Bot Control

- **All CLI commands** — Publish, download, update, extend, delete, verify, diagnose
- **Live logs** — Real-time output streaming via Server-Sent Events
- **Job management** — Cancel running/queued jobs, repeat completed jobs with one click
- **Bot self-update** — Update the bot binary directly from the UI (admin only)
- **Version info** — About modal shows GUI version, bot version, and GitHub release details; context-sensitive button guides through update vs. compatibility check

#### Job Queue

The bot uses a **single-concurrency FIFO queue** — only one job runs at a time, additional jobs wait with a visible queue position. This is intentional:

- Each job opens a **Chromium browser** (headless by default — see Browser Mode below) and logs into kleinanzeigen.de
- Parallel sessions would cause login conflicts, browser crashes, and YAML write races
- After each job completes, **post-job hooks** run automatically (orphan detection, duplicate migration)
- The next job starts only after hooks finish

Each job has one of eight states, shown in the job list and pill:

| Status | When it occurs |
|--------|----------------|
| `queued` | Waiting in the FIFO queue (shows position, e.g. `queued (#2)`) |
| `running` | Currently executing |
| `completed` | Finished successfully |
| `completed with errors` | Finished, but some ads failed |
| `failed` | Aborted with an error |
| `login required` | Hit a login wall and could not log in automatically |
| `mfa required` | Kleinanzeigen.de requested an SMS/email code — awaiting input |
| `waiting for login` | Paused at a manual-login step (visible/VNC mode) — awaiting the user to sign in, then the job resumes |

#### Browser Mode & Live View

Set how the bot's browser runs under **Settings → Browser**:

- **Auto** (default) — runs headless; if a login is required, a one-time **manual login window** (embedded noVNC) opens automatically, then the job re-runs
- **Always headless** — no login fallback; a login wall fails the job
- **Always visible (VNC)** — the bot attaches to a visible Chromium you can **watch live** via "Chrome öffnen" while it works

The visible browser auto-stops after 10 min idle (or via "Beenden"); login sessions persist across runs via the refresh token, so re-login is rarely needed.

> **Security note:** the noVNC stream (`/bot-browser/`) is guarded by a per-session random token in its URL, not by the app's JWT. The token is same-origin and short-lived — but on a **shared multi-user** instance, run behind HTTPS so the token can't be intercepted.

#### MFA / Two-Factor Authentication

- **Automatic detection** — Bot detects when kleinanzeigen.de requires SMS or email verification
- **In-app MFA flow** — Banner notification + overlay modal for code submission
- **Session continuity** — Bot pauses at MFA prompt, resumes after code entry
- **Job status tracking** — Dedicated `mfa_required` state visible in job list and pill

#### Scheduling & Automation

- **Cron-based schedules** — Create recurring bot jobs with cron expressions
- **Preset times** — Daily (6/12/18 AM), every 6/12 hours, weekday-specific
- **All commands** — Schedule any bot command (publish, download, update, extend, verify)
- **Status tracking** — Last run, last status, next scheduled execution
- **Enable/disable** — Toggle schedules without deleting them

#### Auto Price Reduction

Automatically lower prices on each republication cycle:

- **Strategies** — Percentage-based (e.g., -10% per repost) or fixed amount (e.g., -15 EUR per repost)
- **Minimum price floor** — Price never drops below configured minimum (required when enabled)
- **Delay options** — Start reduction after N reposts or N days since first publication
- **Rounding** — All prices rounded to whole euros (commercial rounding, ROUND_HALF_UP)
- **Live preview** — Compact chip view or full timeline showing dates, repost numbers, and calculated prices
- **Validation warnings** — Alerts when reduction is ineffective due to rounding or config issues

> Price reductions only trigger on `publish` (delete + re-create). The `update` command does NOT reduce prices.

### Multi-User & Authentication

- **JWT-based auth** — 15-minute access tokens + httpOnly refresh cookies; silent renewal keeps sessions alive without re-login
- **"Stay signed in"** — Optional 30-day persistent session via httpOnly refresh cookie; without it the session ends when the browser closes
- **Role system** — Admin (full access) and User (personal workspace only)
- **Workspace isolation** — Each user gets their own ads, config, templates, schedules, and browser profile
- **Invite system** — Admin generates invite links (7-day expiry) for registration
- **User management** — Admin can edit roles, reset passwords, delete users
- **Rate limiting** — Login, registration, and setup endpoints are rate-limited
- **Security headers** — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options enforced

### Templates

- **Save as template** — Turn any ad into a reusable template with one click
- **Template CRUD** — Create, edit, delete templates with slug-based naming
- **Quick creation** — Create new ads pre-filled from template values (title, description, category, price, shipping)

### Dashboard & Analytics

- **Statistics grid** — Online count, drafts, orphaned, expiring soon, total value, average price, repost counts
- **Health indicators** — Missing images, inactive ads, price at minimum, no description
- **Schedule calendar** — 7-day visual calendar showing upcoming republications and expirations (inactive ads excluded)
- **Charts** — Price distribution histogram, category breakdown bars, status distribution donut
- **Performance metrics** — Top repost ads, time-on-market bars, price reduction tracking
- **Live KA stats** — Per-ad visitor counts, watchlist counts, and expiry dates in sortable table

### Messaging

- **Inbox** — Split-panel view with conversation list and chat (responsive, mobile-optimized)
- **Real-time chat** — Send and receive messages with optimistic rendering (instant feedback)
- **AI auto-responder** — Automatic or review-mode reply generation via LLM (OpenRouter)
- **Out-of-office note** — Fixed away message sent once per conversation while you're on vacation (no API key required)
- **AI message tracking** — AI-sent messages shown with purple bubble and icon to distinguish from manual messages
- **Escalation detection** — Custom keywords and scheduling requests trigger manual review
- **Pending review** — Edit, approve, or reject AI-generated replies before sending
- **Anti-bot detection** — Random response delays (30–120s) and poll jitter (20–35s)

### Account (Profile)

Per-user settings (each user in multi-user mode has their own):

- **Login credentials** — kleinanzeigen.de username/password
- **Contact defaults** — Name, phone, address, zip/location with PLZ autocomplete
- **Ad defaults** — Type, price type, shipping type, direct sell
- **Republication & price reduction** — Repost interval (default: 7 days) and auto price reduction
- **Description prefix/suffix** — Text prepended/appended to all ad descriptions
- **AI messaging** — Mode (off / out-of-office / review / auto), out-of-office note, escalation keywords, availability, personality, custom rules

### Settings (Global, admin only)

Bot-wide settings that apply to all workspaces:

- **Publishing / deleting / download** — Default behavior for the `publish`, `delete`, and `download` commands
- **Browser mode** — Auto / always headless / always visible (VNC) — see [Browser Mode & Live View](#browser-mode--live-view)
- **AI** — OpenRouter API key and prompt templates for AI ad generation (shared across all workspaces)



### Browser Extensions (CDP Injection)

Chrome extensions don't work with the bot's automation library (nodriver sets `--test-type` which disables extension loading). As a workaround, JavaScript fixes are injected directly via Chrome DevTools Protocol.

**How it works:** When the bot starts Chrome, the runner detects the CDP WebSocket port from the bot output and injects all enabled scripts via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`. Scripts run on every page navigation automatically.

**Configuration** (`extensions.yaml`):
```yaml
extensions:
  - name: Shipping Dialog Fix
    file: shipping-dialog-fix.js
    enabled: true        # set to false to disable
    description: Fixes shipping dialog selectors
```

**Adding a new script:** Place a `.js` file in `extensions/` and add an entry to `extensions.yaml`. **Removing:** Delete the entry and the file, or set `enabled: false`.

If `extensions.yaml` or the `extensions/` directory don't exist, the system is completely inactive and the bot runs normally.

```

#### Components

- **Reverse proxy** — nginx on port 3000 is the single same-origin entrypoint: it proxies the Next.js app (internal port 3001) and exposes noVNC under `/bot-browser/`
- **Frontend + Backend** — Next.js 15 App Router: React UI and API routes in a single process
- **Bot** — [kleinanzeigen-bot](https://github.com/Second-Hand-Friends/kleinanzeigen-bot) binary, spawned as async child process
- **Browser** — Chromium for interacting with kleinanzeigen.de (one instance at a time); runs headless or, in visible mode, attached to a VNC display for manual login
- **VNC stack** — Xvnc + websockify + noVNC let the GUI embed an in-browser session for manual Kleinanzeigen login; per-workspace instances spawned on demand
- **Messaging** — Gateway polls and answers buyer messages (responder + prompt templates) via `/api/messages`
- **CDP Scripts** — JavaScript fixes injected via Chrome DevTools Protocol for site compatibility
- **Data** — YAML files for ads, config, templates, schedules — organized in per-user workspaces
- **Process management** — Process groups for clean bot + chromium cleanup, orphaned process detection

#### Data Flow

```
User Action (UI)
  → API Route (validation + auth)
    → Bot Queue (FIFO, single concurrency)
      → Bot Process (Chromium + kleinanzeigen.de)
        → YAML files updated
          → Post-job hooks (orphan detection, migration)
            → Next job starts
```

#### Ad Sync Pipeline

```
Every bot run with Chrome (login detected)
  → fetchAdStats() → .ad-stats.json updated (views, watchlist, state, expires)
  → syncOnlineIdsFromApi() → .last_download_all.json updated
  → paused ads → active: false in local YAML
  → un-paused ads → active: true restored in local YAML
  → GET /api/ads reads JSON → computes is_orphaned + is_reserved per ad

download --ads=all additionally
  → Hook scans downloaded-ads/ → collects online IDs
  → Orphans with title+category match → migrate settings, delete old file
  → Orphans without match → set active: false, archive folder
  → GET /api/ads → UI displays "Verwaist" badge + grayscale
```

## Deployment

### Option A — Docker, pre-built image (easiest)

No clone required. Download only the `docker-compose.yml` and start:

```bash
mkdir kleinanzeigen-bot-ui && cd kleinanzeigen-bot-ui
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkd3sign/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/main/docker/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Docker pulls the pre-built image from [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/bkd3sign/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/pkgs/container/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui) automatically. No build step needed.

The image is multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) — Docker pulls the variant matching your host automatically, so the same `docker-compose.yml` works on x86 servers, Apple Silicon, and 64-bit ARM devices (Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM NAS) alike.

Local/LAN mode (HTTP) is the default — no configuration needed. Only set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in the compose file if you're running behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik).

---

### Option B — Docker, build from source

Clone the repo, build the image locally, and deploy to your server:

```bash
# On your local machine
./docker/build.sh
rsync -av docker/export/ user@server:/path/to/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/

# On the server
docker compose up -d --build
```

Use this if you want to customize the Dockerfile or pin a specific bot version:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --build-arg BOT_RELEASE=2025-05-15
```

**Container resources:**

| Resource | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Memory limit | 2 GB |
| Shared memory | 512 MB (required for Chromium) |
| tmpfs | 1 GB (`/tmp` scratch space) |
| Port mapping | `3737` (host) → `3000` (container, nginx) |
| Volume | `.:/workspace` — config, ads, bot binary, user data |

**VNC login stack:** The image includes nginx, websockify, noVNC, and Xvnc (TigerVNC). Port 3000 inside the container is served by nginx, which proxies the Next.js app (internal port 3001) and exposes noVNC same-origin under `/bot-browser/`. This allows the GUI to open an in-browser VNC session for manual Kleinanzeigen login without leaving the app. Per-workspace Xvnc and Chromium instances are spawned on demand — nothing runs unless a VNC login is triggered.

---

### Option C — Linux / LXC without Docker

A one-line installer — no clone required. It downloads the app, installs Node.js, Chromium, and the bot binary, then sets up a systemd service. No Docker required.

**Supported systems:**

| OS | Version | Notes |
|----|---------|-------|
| Debian | 13 (Trixie) or newer | ⚠️ Debian 12 (Bookworm) **not** supported — glibc too old |
| Ubuntu | 24.04 LTS or newer | ⚠️ Ubuntu 22.04 **not** supported |
| Arch Linux | rolling | ⚠️ Best-effort — stock nginx doesn't auto-load `conf.d/`, so the VNC proxy needs a manual `include` |

**Architectures:** `x86_64` (amd64), `aarch64` (arm64 — Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4, 5)

**Requirements:**

| Resource | Minimum | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Disk space | ~2 GB free | Node.js build output + bot binary |
| RAM | ~2 GB | Next.js build requires ~1.5 GB — add swap if less |

> **Raspberry Pi:** Must run a 64-bit OS. 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS is not supported.

> **Proxmox LXC:** If using an unprivileged container, add `lxc.apparmor.profile: unconfined` to `/etc/pve/lxc/<ID>.conf` on the host and restart the container before running the installer.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkd3sign/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/main/install.sh -o /tmp/install.sh
sudo bash /tmp/install.sh
```

The installer guides you through all settings interactively. For non-interactive use, pass defaults via environment variables:

```bash
sudo INSTALL_DIR=/opt/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui \
     WORKSPACE_DIR=/opt/workspace \
     PORT=3737 \
     SERVICE_USER=botuser \
     BOT_RELEASE=latest \
     bash /tmp/install.sh --yes
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `/opt/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui` | App source + Next.js build output |
| `WORKSPACE_DIR` | `/opt/workspace` | Config, ads, bot binary, user data |
| `PORT` | `3737` | Web interface port |
| `SERVICE_USER` | `botuser` | User the systemd service runs as (`botuser` recommended, or `root` or custom) |
| `BOT_RELEASE` | `latest` | Bot binary release tag (e.g. `2026+fd3bf64`) |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | *(unset)* | Set to `true` only if running behind an HTTPS reverse proxy |

**Workspace layout after installation:**

```
$WORKSPACE_DIR/              (default: /opt/workspace)
├── bot/
│   └── kleinanzeigen-bot    Bot binary (auto-downloaded)
├── ads/                     Ad YAML files
├── users/                   Per-user workspaces (multi-user mode)
├── .temp/                   Temporary bot files
└── config.yaml              Bot config — auto-created from template, fill in via /setup
```

These additional files are created automatically by the app on first use:

```
$WORKSPACE_DIR/
├── users.yaml               App users, roles & JWT secret
├── schedules.yaml           Cron automation config
├── extensions.yaml          CDP script injection config
└── extensions/              Injected browser scripts
```

**VNC/nginx stack:**

nginx fronts your chosen port as a same-origin proxy: `/` → the app (loopback `127.0.0.1:3001`), `/bot-browser/` → websockify (`127.0.0.1:6080`) for noVNC. A `kleinanzeigen-bot-vnc.service` runs websockify; Xvnc/Chromium start on demand — same **manual login window** as Docker, nothing runs until a login is triggered.

Behind your own reverse proxy (Caddy/Traefik) with `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, point it at that same port — nginx listens there and forwards `X-Forwarded-For`.

**Service management:**

```bash
systemctl status kleinanzeigen-bot-ui      # app status
systemctl status kleinanzeigen-bot-vnc     # VNC/websockify status
journalctl -u kleinanzeigen-bot-ui -f      # live app logs
systemctl restart kleinanzeigen-bot-ui     # restart app
```

---

### Setup (all options)

After starting via any option, open `http://<your-ip>:3737/setup` and complete:

1. **Credentials** — Kleinanzeigen.de email + password
2. **Contact** — Name, ZIP code, city
3. **AI** *(optional)* — OpenRouter API key for AI-powered ad generation

### Updates

| Method | How to update |
|--------|---------------|
| Docker (pre-built) | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |
| Docker (from source) | Re-run `build.sh`, redeploy, `docker compose up -d --build` |
| Linux / install.sh | `sudo bash /opt/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/install.sh --update` (~3 min). First upgrade onto the VNC release only: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkd3sign/kleinanzeigen-bot-ui/main/install.sh -o /tmp/install.sh && sudo bash /tmp/install.sh --update`. |
| Bot binary only | Admin → Bot-Update in the web UI |

## Security

Designed for **trusted environments** (home network, family use). Kleinanzeigen.de credentials are stored in plain text in `config.yaml` — only deploy for users you trust. JWT auth (15 min access tokens + 30 day httpOnly refresh cookies), rate limiting, and security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) are built in. Use a reverse proxy with HTTPS if exposed beyond localhost, and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in your deployment config.
